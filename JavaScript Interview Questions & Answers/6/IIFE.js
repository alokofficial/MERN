// What is an IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)?

// An IIFE is a function that is invoked immediately after it is defined.
(function () {
  // logic here
})(); 

//The primary reason to use an IIFE is to obtain data privacy because any variables declared within the IIFE cannot be accessed by the outside world. i.e, If you try to access variables from the IIFE then it throws an error.

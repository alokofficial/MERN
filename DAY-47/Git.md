## 1. Introduction to Version Control

``` 
1. A system that tracks changes to files over
time
2. Manages different versions of source code
and documents.
3. Tracks modifications and maintains a history
of file versions.
4. Allows multiple people to work on the same
project
5. Records who made what changes and when
6. Facilitates collaboration by managing
contributions and changes from different
team members.

```

```
1. Manual Versioning: Early developers used to
manually name file versions.
2. Local Version Control Systems: Initial tools
like RCS stored versions on individual
machines.
3. Centralized Version Control: Systems like
CVS and SVN introduced a single server to
store files.
4. Distributed Version Control: Tools like Git
and Mercurial allow users to have full
project history on their local machines.
